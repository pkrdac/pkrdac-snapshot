## eosDAC Community

eosDAC "active" members are able to receive up to 20% of PKRDAC's maximum supply based on their % ownership of EOSDAC tokens.

## Maximum Supply

PKRDAC's maximum supply will remain as 10M.

## Burned supply

The following accounts are not eligible to receive PKRDAC tokens and will be burned from circulation:

- `eospokerwins`
- `eospokermine`

## Frozen supply

Due to suspicious activities, the following accounts are not eligible in the initial PKRDAC distribution.

These accounts have the right to submit a claim to PKRDAC; if approved the elected custodians will issue their rightful PKRDAC tokens.
